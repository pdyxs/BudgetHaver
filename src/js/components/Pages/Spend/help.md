Whenever you spend money, log it here. You should log this at the point of decision (so if some of the money will be automatically paid later, put it in when you set that up).

Things you shouldn't log:
 * Recurring costs - these affect your daily budget
 * Savings - just lower your daily budget to start saving
 * ATM Withdrawals - you still have the money!
