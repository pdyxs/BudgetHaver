_Budget Haver_ is a minimalistic budgeting app, designed to force you to make everyday spending decisions consciously.

To use it, first choose a daily budget in the <i class="far fa-cog"></i> Settings tab. This amount will be added to your balance each day.

Then, whenever you spend money, log it in the <i class="far fa-dollar-sign"></i> Spend tab. You should log this at the point of decision (so if some of the money will be automatically paid later, put it in when you set that up).

Finally, take your balance seriously. Going below 0 is bad.

Things you shouldn't log:
 * Recurring costs - these affect your daily budget
 * Savings - just lower your daily budget to start saving
 * ATM Withdrawals - you still have the money!
